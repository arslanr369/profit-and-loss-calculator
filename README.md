# profit-and-loss-calculator
here is a simple example of how you can create a profit and loss calculator using Python's Tkinter library.

This program creates a window with two input fields for sales and cost of goods sold, and a button to calculate the profit or loss. When the button is clicked, the profit or loss is calculated and displayed in a label below the input fields.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
